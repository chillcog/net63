# Dark Web Payments

Today we will learn about handling payments safely on the dark web.

### Explanation
Payments on the dark web often use cryptocurrencies for anonymity. Traditional methods like credit cards are traceable and risky.

#### Key Concepts:
##### Cryptocurrencies: Digital currencies like Bitcoin, Monero.
##### Tumblers/Mixers: Services to obscure transaction origins.
##### Escrow: Third-party holds funds until delivery.

### Technical:
#### How Crypto Payments Work:
Transactions are recorded on blockchain, but privacy coins like Monero hide details. Tumblers mix coins to break traceability.

#### Security Benefits:
Anonymity, no bank involvement, but volatile and irreversible.

#### Escrow Services:
Escrow acts as a trusted third party holding funds until the transaction is complete. On the dark web, multisig wallets or services like escrow sites ensure buyer and seller protection. For example, funds are released only after goods are delivered or agreed upon.

## How to setup one properly:

### General Best Practices
1. Use privacy-focused coins like Monero.
2. Generate new wallets for each transaction.
3. Use tumblers to mix funds.

Obscure origins.

#### General
